# Critical and Near-critical Interfaces

The reading group will focus on random interfaces that should arise as the scaling limits of massive/near-critical models in statistical mechanics. The most well-known critical interface models are the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) and Conformal Loop Ensembles (CLE). While the study of critical interfaces has seen many advances in the past two decades, a general theory for near-critical interfaces remains elusive. However, a few rigorous examples of massive interface models have been constructed in the last few years, which we will also explore.

We will begin by discussing the general properties of SLE and providing an overview of the expected properties of massive interfaces. From there, we will explore other important constructions for critical interfaces, followed by descriptions of a few examples of massive interfaces that have already been described. Finally, we will review some results in the physics literature that are related to massive models.

## Time (to confirm)
We are planning to meet weekly on Thursdays at 15h00 for 60' to 90' and have 9 or 10 meetings in total. Please let me know if you are interested but cannot join at this time.
We will confirm the room soon!
