Here is a quick list of events in the next year or so that I found interesting. This list reflects my personal preferences, but I think it might be useful to others.

Other places to find events:
- [Institute for Mathematical Statistics](https://imstat.org/meetings-calendar/)
- [Women in Mathematics](http://womeninprobability.org/Calendar.html)
- [Carl Muller Webpage](https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/cmlr/advice/)
