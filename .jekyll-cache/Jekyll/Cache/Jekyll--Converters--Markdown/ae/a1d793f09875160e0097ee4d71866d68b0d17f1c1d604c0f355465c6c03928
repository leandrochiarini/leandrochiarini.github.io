<p>Most times I am collaborating with other researchers, we end up using Dropbox to
keep the updated version of the article. More often than not, we both have
copies of these same Dropbox folders somewhere else in our computers just to
avoid conflicts or lose a previous version of our files (I know that one can see
files from up to 30 days old on the website, or even more with the premium
features, but I donâ€™t find those particularly convenient). This can get clunky
and often leads to dozens of different files with slightly different names. 
Even worse if you are sending versions back and forth by email.</p>
